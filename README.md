# Gestione Viaggi

This command line application written in C is a simulation of an airline ticket booking software. 

The objective of this project was to employ weighted graph algorithms on a system of cities and links between said cities, representing the flight network of the airline company, with the possibility of adding and removing cities and links. Users should be able to book flights and choose the cheapest or fastest destination, departing from a selected city.

All the data structures employed (linked lists, AVL binary trees, weighted graphs) were implemented from scratch along with the algorithms to manipulate them.
